## **A few words about me**
Hi! My name is Victor, i'm 26. I've realized I don't like my last profession and i've decided to study front-end development at RS School. I would my future work to benefit people. This is my goal. I'm a fun guy, love talking to people. My hobby is cycling on my fixed gear bike with my friends.
